# Dylan McGehee
## I am 26 years old, and my birthday is next week.
My goals for this course include:
1. Finishing/graduating the course, no matter how difficult.
2. Learn more about coding languages, the industry, what habits to develop to better myself and to make myself more appealing for entry-level development roles
3. Earn one interview before the end of the course and a full time position by late September.
